# JHU Data Patterns And Representations Final Project

Description:

As the 2026 Winter Olympics are currently being held, a lot of questions came to mind about factors that could be advantageous to become an Olympic winning country or athlete. Many countries invest in developing their Olympic athletes with the goal of achieving a gold medal. An analysis of Olympic data from the past century can help identify trends and variables associated with a higher probability of winning a gold medal. This can impact how a country wants to invest in their athletes and impact an athlete’s plan of their Olympic career. Explaining the variables associated with increased chance of winning medals can be done through the perspective of a country or an individual athlete. These kinds of insights could potentially help smaller countries, and their athletes, improve their odds of winning by making more strategic decisions about how and when they invest in sports. 

Questions: 
1. Are gold medals diversifying over time or are the same top countries increasing their concentration?  
2. If the country is hosting the Olympics, do they tend to have a higher rate of winning medals? Does that continue or drop off after they’ve hosted?  
3. If an athlete participates in the team competition, would they do better or worse in their individual competitions? (figure skating, gymnastics, swimming, etc.)  
4. Do athletes that participate in multiple Olympic games tend to climb the rankings and win medals more than first time Olympians?  
5. Do athletes that win gold early in their career continue with the same consistency? 
6. Does the choice of host country have any impact on how many medals a participant country wins? For example: “Do European countries win more medals when the games are hosted in Europe?”
